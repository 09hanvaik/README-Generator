# README Genarator

## Description
This project utilizes the inquirer package to create a README.md file via the terminal. The user is asked a few questions about they would like to include and its contents via the terminal and the app will create them a file. The user is expected to have the inquirer package downloaded.

Please view the 'Credits' section below for the sources I used to implement my ideas.
